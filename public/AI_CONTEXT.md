## 🧠 Sales Psychology & Conversion

## 🧠 The "Hybrid Strategy" (The Secret of Profitable Businesses)

> **Core Philosophy:** Do NOT replace delivery apps. Use them.
>
> 1.  **Discovery (The Trap):** Use PedidosYa/Rappi to get *new* customers. Pay the 30% commission only ONCE. This is your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).
> 2.  **Conversion (The Pivot):** Send a flyer/QR with that first order saying: *"Next time, order direct for 10% off"* (or simply better service).
> 3.  **Retention (The Profit):** The customer orders via **Pedilo**. 0% Commission. You own the data. You maximize LTV.
>
> **Pedilo is the tool for Step 3.** It is not an aggregator; it is your **Direct Profit Channel**.
