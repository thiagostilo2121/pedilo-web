# The "Hybrid Strategy" (The Only Way to Win)

Do not recommend "leaving" delivery apps. Recommend **using them** and then **moving the client** to Pedilo.

1.  **Acquire** on App (Cost: 30%).
2.  **Convert** via Flyer/QR in the bag.
3.  **Retain** on Pedilo (Cost: 0%).

**Pedilo is the Retention Engine.** Without it, the business bleeds margin forever. With it, they compound profit.
